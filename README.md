# Blazor WASM ServiceWorker Demo

This code demonstrates loading a Blazor WASM inside a ServiceWorker context and handling any events a ServiceWorker may want to such as fetch.

This is currently a working proof onf concept and likely to change. Any and all feedback is welcome!

This project relies on my other repo [SpawnDev.BlazorJS](https://github.com/LostBeard/SpawnDev.BlazorJS) and more specifically [SpawnDev.BlazorJS.WebWorkers](https://github.com/LostBeard/SpawnDev.BlazorJS#spawndevblazorjswebworkers)
